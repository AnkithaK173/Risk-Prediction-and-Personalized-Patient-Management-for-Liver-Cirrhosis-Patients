**Project Title**:
# **Risk Prediction and Personalized Patient Management for Liver Cirrhosis Patients**

---

### **Project Overview**

This project aims to leverage patient data to predict the risk levels and disease progression for individuals with liver cirrhosis. By analyzing patient demographics, lifestyle habits, and medical history, we build predictive models and identify key patient segments. This approach assists in resource allocation and enables healthcare providers to create individualized care plans.

### **Dataset**

The dataset consists of several columns capturing key demographic, medical, and lifestyle attributes of liver cirrhosis patients. It includes the following columns:
- **Patient_ID**: Unique identifier for each patient.
- **Age**: Age of the patient.
- **Gender**: Gender of the patient (e.g., Male, Female).
- **Medical_History**: Detailed medical history relevant to liver cirrhosis.
- **Lifestyle_Factors**: Information on alcohol use, smoking habits, etc.
- **Disease_Progression**: Indicator of how the disease has progressed (severity score, stages, etc.)
- **Risk_Level**: Classified risk level (e.g., low, medium, high).

### **Goals**

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a predictive model to categorize patients into different risk levels.
2. **Classification and Regression**: Use classification to identify high-risk patients and regression to predict disease progression.
3. **Segmentation**: Segment patients based on demographics and risk factors for targeted interventions.
4. **Data Visualization**: Use Power BI/Tableau for visualization to enhance interpretability and decision-making.

### **Tech Stack**

- **Python**: For data analysis, EDA, machine learning, and feature engineering.
- **MySQL**: For database querying.
- **Power BI/Tableau**: For visualizing key insights and results.

### **Project Workflow**

1. **Upload the Dataset to GitHub**:
   - Create a repository named `LiverCirrhosis_RiskPrediction`.
   - Add a folder named `data`, and upload the dataset (`liver_cirrhosis.csv`) into this folder.
   - Push the initial commit with the dataset file.

2. **Data Analysis and Modeling Steps (in Python)**:
   - Set up a Google Colab notebook or local Jupyter notebook.
   - Import essential libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, etc.

### **Detailed Steps**

#### **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

- **Data Overview**:
  - Load the dataset and display its first few rows to understand its structure.
  - Check data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - **Distribution Analysis**: Plot histograms to examine the distributions of numerical columns like `Age`.
  - **Outlier Detection**: Use box plots to detect outliers.
  - **Correlation Analysis**: Create a heatmap to understand relationships between variables.
  - **Risk Level Analysis**: Use bar charts and pie charts to visualize the distribution of patients across different risk levels.

#### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

- **Handling Missing Values**: Impute missing values as appropriate for each column.
- **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Convert categorical columns like `Gender` and `Risk_Level` to numerical form using one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Scaling**: Standardize or normalize numerical columns like `Age` to ensure uniformity in the dataset.

#### **3. Feature Engineering**

- **Feature Creation**: If necessary, create new features based on existing ones (e.g., combining `Age` and `Medical_History` to create an `Age_at_Onset` feature).
- **Feature Selection**: Use correlation, statistical tests, or feature importance from models like Random Forest to retain only relevant features.

#### **4. Splitting the Dataset**

- Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 or 70-30 split.

#### **5. Model Training and Evaluation**

- **Classification Models**:
  - Train various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict `Risk_Level`.
  - **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

- **Regression Model**:
  - Train a regression model to predict `Disease_Progression`.
  - **Evaluation**: Use mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for assessment.

- **Clustering and Segmentation**:
  - Apply **K-Means Clustering** to identify distinct patient segments.
  - Visualize clusters using scatter plots to observe segmented groups.

#### **6. Hyperparameter Tuning**

- Use **Grid Search** and **Cross-Validation** to optimize model parameters for better accuracy and generalization.

#### **7. Model Comparison and Selection**

- Compare model performances and choose the best-performing models for classification, regression, and segmentation tasks.
- Document the chosen model's metrics and interpret key findings.

#### **8. Exporting Results**

- **Excel Export**: Save the processed data and prediction results to an Excel file (`processed_data.xlsx`).
- **SQL Queries**: Import the Excel file into MySQL to run the following queries.

### **SQL Queries for MySQL**

1. Retrieve all data from the processed table.
2. Count patients by risk level.
3. List high-risk patients aged over 50.
4. Calculate the average age of patients per risk group.
5. Sum cases by gender and risk group.
6. Identify top 5 patients with the highest progression scores.
7. Join any additional tables if applicable.
8. Retrieve patients with specific comorbidity criteria.
9. Filter data by treatment start or end date.
10. Find patients exceeding certain risk thresholds.
11. Locate patients with specific lifestyle factors (e.g., heavy alcohol).
12. Determine risk level trends over time.
13. Count patients by medical history category.
14. Segment patients by demographic and medical criteria.
15. Create a view for high-risk patients.

### **Visualization in Power BI/Tableau**

1. **Risk Level Distribution by Demographics**: Visualize risk levels by age, gender, and other demographics.
2. **Disease Progression Trends**: Line chart showing progression over time.
3. **Clustered Segmentation**: Scatter plot of clustered patient segments.
4. **Model Accuracy Comparison**: Bar chart comparing model accuracies.
